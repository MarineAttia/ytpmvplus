# ytpmvplus
I have always wanted to make YTPMVs but because I'm a windows of vs2019 also don't like the tedious process of pitching and placing videos in vegas, I decided to write a tool to do it automatically It is a library of utilities with (1) music parser (2) audio renderer (3) video source renderer. (4) video clip created To make a YTPMV you would write a program that invokes the music audio parser, goes through each note, and creates audio &amp; video segments as you see fit. Any audio or music .mp3/.mod/.xm/.it with sony vegas (after some manual fixing). There are a few source ytpmv video if you click the examples link in README.  The eventual goal of this is to be able to make very advanced YTPMV+ in under an hour.  What do you all think? #ytpmv #otomad #program
